# Soduku
My attempts at making an imperfect solution for the Soduko puzzle. 

### First Attempt

[Attempt 1](https://github.com/StickyShoe/Soduku/blob/master/attempt_1.java)
<br>
Created in Java . It works for most hard level Soduko but has a lack of implementation of sufficient strategies.
Mostly uses Naked Single elimination.

### Second Attempt  

[Attempt 2](https://github.com/StickyShoe/Soduku/blob/master/attempt_2.py)
<br>
Created in Python(v3) . This is the current build and hopefully be able to have much more strategic implementations into algorithmic form
